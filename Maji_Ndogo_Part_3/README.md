## Comprehensive Report on Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project

### Introduction

#### Project Overview

The Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project is a comprehensive data exploration and analysis initiative aimed at addressing the pressing water scarcity issues in Maji Ndogo. This project is of paramount importance due to the severe impact of water shortages on the local populationâ€™s health, economy, and overall quality of life. The main objectives of the project include cleaning and updating the data, analyzing the geographical distribution of water sources, investigating the extent of the water crisis, and developing strategies to mitigate the crisis.

#### Significance

The significance of this project lies in its potential to provide actionable insights that can lead to sustainable solutions for the water crisis in Maji Ndogo. By leveraging data-driven analysis, we can identify key problem areas, prioritize interventions, and ultimately improve water access and quality for the affected communities.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

#### Task 1: Updating Employee Email Addresses

We began by examining the employee table to understand its structure. Email addresses for each employee were generated in the format first_name.last_name@ndogowater.gov. This process involved replacing spaces with dots, converting the names to lowercase, and concatenating the resulting strings to form the email addresses.

#### Task 2: Cleaning Phone Numbers

To ensure the accuracy of the phone numbers, we identified and removed any extra characters. This involved using the LENGTH and TRIM functions to clean the data and update the employee table accordingly.

### Data Analysis

#### Task 3: Analyzing Employee Locations

To understand the geographical distribution of employees, we counted the number of employees residing in each town. This information is crucial for planning resource allocation and field operations.

#### Recognizing Top Field Surveyors

We identified the top three field surveyors based on the number of locations they visited. This recognition not only boosts morale but also helps in understanding the workload and efficiency of our field staff.

### Geographical Distribution of Water Sources

#### Count Records per Town and Province

We analyzed the number of records per town and per province to understand the spread of water sources across different regions. This analysis helps in identifying areas with the highest concentration of water sources and potential hotspots for water scarcity.

#### Count Records per Location Type

We also counted the number of records per location type, differentiating between rural and urban sources. This is critical for understanding the distribution of water sources in different settings and planning targeted interventions.

### Water Source Analysis

#### Total People Surveyed

We surveyed a total of 27,628,140 people to gather data on water sources and their usage. This extensive survey provides a robust dataset for analysis and decision-making.

#### Types and Distribution of Water Sources

Our analysis revealed the distribution of various water sources such as wells, taps, and rivers. We found that wells are the most common source, followed by taps in homes, shared taps, and rivers.

#### Average Number of People Served

We calculated the average number of people served by each type of water source. Shared taps serve the highest number of people on average, highlighting their critical role in water access.

#### Population Served by Each Source

We determined the total population served by each type of water source. Shared taps serve the largest portion of the population, followed by wells and taps in homes.

#### Percentage of Population Using Each Source

We calculated the percentage of the population served by each type of water source. This analysis helps in understanding the reliance on different water sources and prioritizing resources accordingly.

### Queue Time Analysis

#### Average Queue Time

We analyzed the average queue time for accessing water. This metric is crucial for understanding the burden on the population and planning interventions to reduce wait times.

#### Queue Times by Day and Hour

We also analyzed queue times on different days of the week and hours of the day. This detailed analysis helps in identifying peak times and planning resource allocation to manage demand effectively.

### Key Insights and Recommendations

1. **Water Sources and Usage**: Shared taps and wells are the primary water sources, serving the largest portions of the population. Prioritizing the maintenance and expansion of these sources can significantly improve water access.

2. **Geographical Distribution**: Understanding the geographical distribution of water sources and employees is crucial for effective planning and resource allocation. Areas with high concentrations of water sources and employees should be prioritized for interventions.

3. **Queue Time Management**: Reducing queue times, especially during peak hours and days, can alleviate the burden on the population. This can be achieved by increasing the number of functional water sources and improving their distribution.

4. **Employee Recognition and Efficiency**: Recognizing top field surveyors and understanding their workload can help in planning field operations more efficiently. This ensures that resources are utilized effectively, and employees are motivated.

### Conclusion

The Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Project has provided valuable insights into the water crisis affecting the region. Through data cleaning, analysis, and strategic planning, we have identified key areas for intervention and developed actionable recommendations to improve water access and quality. Continued data-driven analysis and collaboration among stakeholders will be essential in addressing the water crisis and ensuring a sustainable solution for the people of Maji Ndogo.

### Next Steps

1. **Implementation of Recommendations**: Begin implementing the recommendations based on the insights gathered from the data analysis.
2. **Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation**: Establish a system for continuous monitoring and evaluation of water sources and employee performance.
3. **Stakeholder Engagement**: Engage with local communities, government agencies, and other stakeholders to ensure a collaborative approach to solving the water crisis.
4. **Scalability and Sustainability**: Develop scalable and sustainable solutions that can be replicated in other regions facing similar challenges.
