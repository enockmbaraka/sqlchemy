# Comprehensive Report on Maji Ndogo: From Analysis to Action

## Introduction

### Project Overview

In a world where access to clean water is a fundamental necessity, the region of Maji Ndogo faces significant challenges in ensuring this basic right for its residents. My project embarked on a critical mission to analyze water quality, collection patterns, and infrastructure in Maji Ndogo, with the goal of uncovering insights that could drive transformative change. This comprehensive report delves into the key findings and implications of the analysis, with a focus on improving water access and quality for the community.

Phase 1:

This data analysis aims to provide insights into the progress of the water services of a fictitious country, Maji Ndogo, over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the water quality data, we seek to identify the problems each water source and the community faces and also the effectiveness of the employees in charge. To make data-driven recommendations and gain deep understanding of the performance we harnessed the power of SQL functions to clean, aggregate data and unravel the scale of the problem to form some actionable insights.

Phase 2:

This project involved confirming removing fake data and fighting corruption in Maji Ndogo. It involves comparing datasets on water quality scores from a turned in data (auditor_report) and filtering errors from the data. Investigating into this errors revealed some corruption during the survey for water sources in Maji Ndogo. Getting the average number of mistakes and comparing with the number of mistakes made by certain employees enabled me get the employees that made above the average number of mistakes. With the statements from the location surveyed by the suspected employees, it was revealed that there was corrupt practices going on. This projejct enabled me to reinforce my knowledge on CTEs, subqueries and views in MySQL.


The project aimed to:
- Investigate patterns of water collection and queue times.
- Identify discrepancies in water quality classifications.
- Analyze infrastructure and its impact on water accessibility.
- Propose actionable solutions to improve water access and quality.

### Personal Motivation

As a young Kenyan passionate about leveraging data for impactful solutions, this project resonates deeply with my personal and professional aspirations. Growing up in Kitui County, a region where water access is often limited, I have first hand experience of the challenges faced by communities like Maji Ndogo. My background in Economics and Statistics has equipped me with the requisite skills to tackle these constraints through data-driven approaches.

This project aligns with my goal of making a tangible difference in the lives of those who lack access to clean water, and it represents a significant step in my journey towards a career dedicated to using data for social good.

## Data Collection and Preparation

### Data Sources

The data for this project was obtained from multiple sources, including:
- **Local Water Authority Records**: Provided historical data on water quality and infrastructure.
- **Community Surveys**: Collected information on water collection habits, queue times, and perceptions of water quality.
- **Field Inspections**: Gathered observational data on water sources and infrastructure conditions.

This constituted the primary dataset used for this analysis the "md_water_services" data, containing detailed information about each water source, employee performance and water quality and tools. "Auditor_report.csv" was also added to the table in the second phase to conduct deep analysis on data inconsistencies.

**Challenges**: Data collection was not without its hurdles. Some survey responses contained incomplete or inconsistent information, and field inspections faced logistical issues in reaching remote areas. Despite these challenges, careful data cleaning and preprocessing ensured a robust dataset for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Missing data was imputed using statistical methods or removed if it could not be reliably estimated.
- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables were encoded, and numerical variables were normalized to facilitate analysis.
- **Quality Assurance**: Cross-referenced data from multiple sources to verify accuracy and consistency.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Descriptive Statistics

The dataset revealed several key statistics:
- **Water Sources**: 43% of the population relied on shared taps, 31% had home infrastructure, and 18% depended on wells.
- **Queue Times**: Average queue time exceeded 120 minutes, with significant variations based on the day of the week and time of day.
- **Water Quality**: Discrepancies were found in the classification of water sources, with some labeled "Clean" showing signs of contamination.

### Data Visualization

- **Queue Time Patterns**: Visualizations highlighted longer queue times on Saturdays and during mornings and evenings. Shorter queue times were observed on Wednesdays and Sundays, indicating cultural practices influencing water collection.
- **Water Quality Discrepancies**: Visual analysis showed misclassifications of water sources, prompting further investigation into data accuracy.

## Analytical Techniques

### Analysis Methods

The project employed a combination of analytical techniques:
- **Clustering**: Used to identify patterns in queue times and water source usage.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Applied to study variations in queue times across different days and times.
- **Quality Assessment**: Techniques were used to evaluate and rectify misclassifications in water quality data.

### Key Findings

- **Disparities in Water Access**: Significant differences in water access were found, with shared taps being a primary source for many, but leading to long queues.
- **Broken Infrastructure**: A substantial portion of the population faced issues with non-functional home infrastructure.
- **Contaminated Wells**: Identified instances of contamination in wells labeled as clean, necessitating corrective measures.

## Business Impact

### Findings/Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

 • For communities using rivers, trucks can be dispatched to those regions to provide water temporarily while crews are sent to drill for wells, providing a more permanent solution.

 • Communities using wells can install filters to purify the water. For wells with biological contamination, UV filters that kill microorganisms, and for polluted wells, we can install reverse osmosis filters. In the long term, we need to figure out why these sources are polluted.

 • For shared taps, in the short term, we can send additional water tankers to the busiest taps, on the busiest days. We can use the queue time pivot table we made to send tankers at the busiest times. Meanwhile, we can start the work on installing extra taps where they are needed. According to UN standards, the maximum acceptable wait time for water is 30 minutes. With this in mind, our aim is to install taps to get queue times below 30 min.

 • Shared taps with short queue times (< 30 min) represent a logistical challenge to further reduce waiting times. The most effective solution, installing taps in homes, is resource-intensive and better suited as a long-term goal.

 • Addressing broken infrastructure offers a significant impact even with just a single intervention. It is expensive to fix, but so many people can benefit from repairing one facility. For example, fixing a reservoir or pipe that multiple taps are connected to. We will have to find the commonly affected areas to see where the problem actually is.
### Potential Return on Investment (ROI)

Investing in these improvements can lead to:
- **Increased Efficiency**: Reduced queue times translate to time savings for residents, which can be redirected towards productive activities.
- **Enhanced Health Outcomes**: Improved water quality will decrease the incidence of waterborne diseases, leading to better public health and reduced healthcare costs.
- **Economic Growth**: Better water access supports economic activities, contributing to the overall development of Maji Ndogo.
