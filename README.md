# Maji Ndogo: From Analysis to Action

Welcome to the Maji Ndogo project! This unique and engaging data-driven journey equips you with highly desirable skills in SQL and data analysis. As you embark on this solo project, you'll immerse yourself in a story-driven simulation of real data projects, data analysis, and good leadership. Here's a breakdown of what you can expect:

## What Will You Be Doing?

### Part 1: Beginning Your Data-Driven Journey in Maji Ndogo
Explore a realistic database with SQL.
Use SQL to clean and explore a database with 60,000 unique records.
Dive into a story-driven simulation of real data projects, data analysis, and good leadership.

### Part 2: Clustering Data to Unveil Maji Ndogo's Water Crisis
Gear up for a data analysis of Maji Ndogo's water scenario.
Aggregate data to unravel the scale of the problem and start forming actionable insights.
Harness the power of SQL functions, including intricate window functions, to draw insights from the data.

### Part 3: Weaving the Data Threads of Maji Ndogo's Narrative
Deal with some of the realities faced in many countries.
Draw from different data sources to deepen the analysis into Maji Ndogo's crisis.
Use advanced SQL tools to assemble the pieces of an audit together.

### Part 4: Charting the Course for Maji Ndogo's Water Future
Assemble your final analysis results and report your findings.
Combine SQL tools to finalize your analysis.
Look to the future as you derive actionable goals and shape the data to achieve them.

## Assessments
This integrated project includes four assessment opportunities. These assessments consist of multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and are based on the activities completed in each week's part:
- Part 1: 10 questions
- Part 2: 10 questions
- Part 3: 10 questions
- Part 4: 10 questions

## Project Instructions Format
Throughout the project, you will be guided by Chidi Kunto, our virtual data analyst, who will help break down tasks and provide valuable insights. Chidi is a role model for data analysts, and you can learn from his leadership, passion, and critical thinking.

The project instructions are presented in a chat-like interface, similar to Google Chat, with unique timestamps. Chidi will share the story, tasks, code blocks, and query results in this space, making it easy to follow along.

## Managing SQL Queries in MySQL Jupyter Notebooks
You will use Jupyter notebooks, which offer an interactive environment for SQL projects. You can write, execute, and store SQL queries, making it a convenient tool for your work. While an example notebook is provided for Part 1, you are encouraged to create your own for the rest of the project.

## Your Main Goal
This project may present challenges, but remember that you're not alone. Your solo journey is an opportunity to sharpen your SQL skills and be well-prepared to tackle real-world problems. Focus on building your skills, and the marks will follow.

Engage fully with this project, and you'll develop the abilities and confidence to excel in SQL and data analysis. Enjoy the journey in Maji Ndogo as you make a positive impact on its water future. ðŸŒŠðŸ“Š
