## Maji Ndogo Water Crisis Analysis

**Introduction**

**1. Project Overview**

This report details a data exploration and analysis project concerning the water crisis in Maji Ndogo, Kenya. The project aims to leverage data insights to develop solutions and improve access to clean water for the region's residents.

Our primary goals include:

* Understanding the current state of water access in Maji Ndogo.
* Identifying areas with the most significant water scarcity challenges.
* Analyzing water source distribution and usage patterns.
* Recommending data-driven solutions for improved water service delivery.

**2. Personal Motivation**

As a passionate data scientist with a background in Economics and Statistics, I am deeply invested in leveraging my skills to address critical global issues. The water crisis is a major concern, and this project resonated with my desire to make a positive impact on people's lives.

Furthermore, my experience growing up in Kenya instilled a deep appreciation for the value of clean water. Witnessing firsthand the struggles communities face due to water scarcity fueled my determination to contribute to solutions in Maji Ndogo. This project aligns perfectly with my career aspirations to utilize data science for social good and sustainable development.

**Data Collection and Preparation**

**3. Data Sources**

The project utilized data from a MySQL database named "md_water_services." This database contains comprehensive information on water sources, user surveys, and employee field visits within Maji Ndogo.

**Data Acquisition**

We established a secure connection to the database using Python libraries like pymysql and SQL. This allowed us to extract and process the relevant data for analysis.

**Data Cleaning and Challenges**

While the data was generally well-structured, there were instances of missing or inconsistent information. We addressed these challenges through:

* Identifying missing values using techniques like null value checks.
* Implementing data cleaning routines to handle inconsistencies in phone numbers and email addresses.
* Utilizing data verification methods to ensure the accuracy of extracted information.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**4. Descriptive Statistics**

Our analysis revealed that:

* Over 27.6 million people reside in Maji Ndogo.
* Shared taps serve the most significant user population (approximately 11.95 million).
* Wells serve a substantial population (around 4.84 million).
* A significant portion of the population (over 3.8 million) relies on non-functional taps within homes.

**5. Data Visualization**

Data visualizations played a crucial role in uncovering patterns and trends. Here are some key takeaways:

* A bar chart highlighted the average queue time during specific hours of the day.

**Analytical Techniques**

**6. Analysis Methods**

We employed various data analysis techniques to gain deeper insights:

* **SQL queries:** Used extensively to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data based on specific criteria.
* **Ranking functions:** Helped prioritize water source improvements by user population served.
* **Time-series analysis:** Explored queue time data to understand daily and hourly usage patterns.

**7. Key Findings**

Our analysis yielded significant findings:

* A substantial portion of the population depends on shared taps, potentially leading to congestion and longer wait times.
* A significant number of people rely on non-functional taps within homes, indicating a need for infrastructure repair or replacement.
* Queue time data revealed variations in wait times throughout the week and day, suggesting potential areas for optimizing water access schedules.

**Business Impact**

**8. Implications of Findings**

These findings have practical implications for improving water access in Maji Ndogo:

* **Prioritizing infrastructure improvements:** Focus on repairing or replacing non-functional taps to reduce reliance on shared sources.
* **Optimizing water distribution:** Analyze queue time data to strategically distribute water and minimize waiting periods.
* **Targeted interventions:** Identify areas with the most critical water scarcity challenges for focused resource allocation.

**Challenges and Solutions**

**9. Obstacles Encountered**

One major challenge involved ensuring data accuracy. We addressed this by:

* Implementing data quality checks throughout the analysis process.
* Consulting with domain experts to verify the interpretation of specific data points.

**Lessons Learned**

This project emphasized the importance of data quality and collaboration. By prioritizing these aspects, we ensured the reliability and effectiveness of our analysis.

**Conclusion and Future Work**

**10. Project Summary**

This data analysis project successfully identified key areas for improvement in Maji Ndogo's water access infrastructure. The findings provide valuable insights for decision-makers to allocate resources effectively and address the water crisis.
